### A full stack web application with technologies of Docker PostGIS, Django, Celery, Redis, Pytest, Django-REST API, Nginx, Axios, React

# There applications are included for now:

## 1. Shale Well Drill and Completion Optimizaation

The application deployed 4 data models that are created with Scikit-learn Machine Learning . The process collected over 3000 horizontal oil and gas wells frilled before 2020 in north-east BC, tested over 25 data features with four Scikit-learn regression algorithms (Artificial Neural Networks, Adaboost, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest), eventually choosen Random Forest algorithm with 6 data features and produced 4 models for the well optimization and production prediction.

The data models help to optimize horizontal well design and frac parameter planning to achieve maximum financial performance

A breif presentation of the project can be found in the blog section of this website.
